*cyclonedx-gomod* creates CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Go modules

## Installation

Prebuilt binaries are available on the [releases](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/releases) page.

### From Source

```
go install github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod@latest
```

Building from source requires Go 1.16 or newer.

## Compatibility

*cyclonedx-gomod* will produce BOMs for the latest version of the CycloneDX specification 
[supported by cyclonedx-go](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go#compatibility).  
You can use the [CycloneDX CLI](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli#convert-command) to convert between multiple 
BOM formats or specification versions. 

## Usage

```
Usage of cyclonedx-gomod:
  -json
        Output in JSON format
  -module string
        Path to Go module (default ".")
  -noserial
        Omit serial number
  -output string
        Output path (default "-")
  -serial string
        Serial number (default [random UUID])
  -type string
        Type of the main component (default "application")
  -version
        Show version
```

In order to be able to calculate hashes, all modules have to be present in Go's module cache.  
Make sure to run `go mod download` before generating BOMs with *cyclonedx-gomod*.

### Example

```
$ go mod tidy
$ go mod download
$ cyclonedx-gomod -output bom.xml 
```

Checkout the [`examples`](./examples) directory for examples of BOMs generated by *cyclonedx-gomod*.

### Hashes

*cyclonedx-gomod* uses the same hashing algorithm Go uses for its module integrity checks.  
[`vikyd/go-checksum`](https://github.com/vikyd/go-checksum#calc-checksum-of-module-directory) does a great job of
explaining what exactly that entails. In essence, the hash you see in a BOM should be the same as in your `go.sum` file,
just in a different format. This is because the CycloneDX specification enforces hashes to be provided in hex encoding,
while Go uses base64 encoded values.

To verify a hash found in a BOM, do the following:

1. Hex decode the value
2. Base64 encode the value
3. Prefix the value with `h1:`

Given the hex encoded hash `a8962d5e72515a6a5eee6ff75e5ca1aec2eb11446a1d1336931ce8c57ab2503b`, we'd end up with a
module checksum of `h1:qJYtXnJRWmpe7m/3XlyhrsLrEURqHRM2kxzoxXqyUDs=`. 
Now, query your [checksum database](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25530-sumdb.md#checksum-database) 
for the expected checksum and compare the values.
